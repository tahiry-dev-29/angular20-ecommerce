# My Angular 20 Simple E-commerce Site

  Welcome to the GitHub repository of my simple e-commerce site, developed with the latest features of **Angular 20**\! This project emphasizes a **reactive architecture** and the use of **signals**, adopting a **ZoneLess** approach for optimized performance. Ready to dive into the future of web development? 

##  Project Overview

  This e-commerce site is a concrete demonstration of Angular 20's capabilities for building modern and ultra-performant web applications. It's designed with a **modular architecture** and **reusable components**, following the best development practices you love so much\! We really aimed to code like pros here.

## Technologies Used

  * **Angular 20**: The frontend framework I adore for fast, reactive, and "full reactivity" web applications, just as you like them\!
  * **ZoneLess**: A key performance optimization that manually manages change detection for maximum fluidity. No more traditional `@Input` and `@Output` decorators\!
  * **Signals**: Extensive use of signals for optimal reactivity and simplified state management. This is the core of Angular 20's new features\!
  * **`@if` and `@for`**: Utilizing the new control flow syntaxes for cleaner conditional rendering and more performant loops, compliant with Angular 20 standards. Say goodbye to `*ngIf` or `*ngFor` warnings\!
  * **TypeScript**: The primary programming language for robust, maintainable, and scalable code. We love type safety\!

## Features

  * **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and adjust item quantities in the cart. Simple yet effective\!

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

  Follow these simple steps to get the application running locally on your machine. It's super easy\!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)

  * **Angular CLI** (version 17.x or higher for Angular 20). If you don't have it yet, install it globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tahiry-dev-29/angular20-ecommerce.git
    cd angular20-ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Launch the application with the `ng serve` command:

```bash
ng serve
```

  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you modify any source files. It's magic\!

### Build for Production

  To build the project for production deployment, use the `ng build` command with the `production` configuration:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

  The generated files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.
